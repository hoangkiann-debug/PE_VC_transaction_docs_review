# Review Quality Gates

Use these gates as the completion contract for every substantive review. A gate
may be marked `passed`, `passed with limitations`, or `blocked`. Do not silently
continue through a blocked gate.

## Gate 0: Matter and Authority

Pass only when the user instructions and file package establish, or the user
authorizes assumptions for:

- Current matter and client side.
- Review round and scope.
- Output mode and language.
- Structure and governing law, or permission to infer them.
- Confidentiality and cross-matter boundary.
- For later rounds, the available version-chain baseline and the limitations
  caused by anything missing.

Verifier: completed matter profile plus an explicit list of assumptions and gaps.

## Gate 1: File Readiness

For every in-scope file, record:

- File type and extraction method.
- Whether text was extracted.
- Page/paragraph or OOXML location quality.
- Whether OCR, manual review, or conversion is required.
- Whether Track Changes markers and text-bearing changes are present.

Block substantive review of a file when extraction is empty or failed. Do not
count successful extraction of other files as proof that the blocked file was
reviewed.

Verifier: `scripts/build_document_map.py` plus extraction results; use
`scripts/smoke_test_transactions.py --strict` for regression verification.

## Gate 2: Package and Version Chain

Confirm:

- Document families, versions, dates, and apparent clean/redline status.
- Primary operative agreement and controlling language.
- Missing common documents and whether review can proceed without them.
- Current markup, prior draft, prior issue log, prior Major Issue List, and
  counterparty response for later-round acceptance/rejection conclusions.
- When both versions are clean, clause-level alignment/change output, confidence
  or ambiguity flags, and any manual-alignment limitations.
- Candidate cross-document conflicts in definitions, amounts, cap-table facts,
  rights families and dispute mechanisms, including unreadable or omitted files.

Treat filename-based structure/language/version output as intake hints only.
Confirm against operative text before relying on it.

Verifier: document map and version-chain table; use
`scripts/compare_contract_versions.py` for clean prior/current files and
`scripts/build_package_matrix.py --strict` for multi-document packages.

## Gate 3: Research Provenance

For every material issue, separate and label:

- Agreement fact or user-provided fact.
- External entity/background fact and query time.
- Market benchmark and benchmark period.
- Legal authority, status, pinpoint, and verification date.
- Pending fact, pending legal research, or local-counsel question.

Verifier: issue-log fields `Market Context`, `Legal Basis`, and
`Authority / Verification Status`; run `scripts/validate_issue_log.py`, independently verify historical
benchmarks before updates or high-stakes reliance, and run
`scripts/refresh_legal_authorities.py` when the registry freshness or coverage
gate is triggered.

## Gate 4: Substantive Coverage

Review every relevant checklist family, including definitions, economics,
closing, warranties/disclosure/indemnity, investor rights, founder restrictions,
governance, transfer/exit, regulatory and compliance covenants, dispute
resolution, boilerplate, schedules, and cross-document consistency.

Record `reviewed`, `not applicable`, `missing document`, or `deferred` for each
family. Absence of an issue is not proof that a family was reviewed.

Verifier: clause coverage matrix and cross-document conflict matrix.

## Gate 5: Recommendation Quality

Each recommendation must contain:

- Precise location and current text or concise excerpt.
- Issue and client-specific position.
- Market context or a reason it is not applicable.
- Legal basis and authority status when legally material.
- Risk level.
- Complete paste-ready wording, or a document/fact request when wording cannot
  responsibly be completed.
- Fallback and any client decision required.

Verifier: issue-log validation plus human spot-check of every high-risk item.

## Gate 6: Negotiation State

For later rounds:

- Preserve the same Issue ID for the same dispute.
- Use exactly one supported status per row.
- Distinguish accepted, partially accepted, rejected, new, reopened, deferred,
  and closed issues from mere text changes.
- Add new counterparty issues without renumbering existing issues.

Verifier: `scripts/update_major_issue_list.py`, followed by
`scripts/validate_major_issue_list.py`.

## Gate 7: Delivery and Confidentiality

Before delivery:

- Match the primary document language.
- Confirm requested output mode and that comments-only review did not modify the
  source document.
- For native comments, confirm unique anchors, separate output, unchanged visible
  text, valid OOXML comment wiring, inserted-count parity, clean render, and a
  tested rollback report.
- Keep the Major Issue List to exactly five semantic columns.
- Remove accidental absolute paths, unrelated matter names, temporary files,
  and internal benchmark source names from user-facing outputs.
- State unreviewed files and material limitations prominently.

Verifier: final file list, validators, source/output hashes and native-comment
apply report where comments-only integrity matters, render inspection, rollback
test, and a targeted confidentiality scan.
